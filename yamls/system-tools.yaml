  summary: Provides the tools a general Linux user expects on the command line
  description: As the modular server is attempting to start from an extrememly
               small baseline, many of the tools one normally expects are not
               provided by default. However, an evaluator of the modular OS
               often needs these tools. At present, there is nowhere to get
               them from, hence the need for this module.
