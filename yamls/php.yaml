    summary: PHP scripting language for creating dynamic web sites
    description: PHP is an HTML-embedded scripting language. PHP attempts to make it
                 easy for developers to write dynamically generated web pages. PHP also
                 offers built-in database integration for several commercial and
                 non-commercial database management systems, so writing a
                 database-enabled webpage with PHP is fairly simple. The most common
                 use of PHP coding is probably as a replacement for CGI scripts.
                 The php package contains the module (often referred to as mod_php)
                 which adds support for the PHP language to Apache HTTP Server.
