    summary: MongoDB Module
    description:  Mongo from humongous is a high-performance, open source, schema-free
                  document-oriented database. MongoDB is written in C++ and offers the following features.  
                  Collection oriented storage, easy storage of object/JSON-style data.  
                  Dynamic queries.     
                  Full index support, including on inner objects and embedded arrays.
                  Query profiling.
                  Replication and fail-over support.
                  Efficient storage of binary data including large objects (e.g. photos and videos).
                  Auto-sharding for cloud-level scalability (currently in early alpha).
                  Commercial Support Available.
                  A key goal of MongoDB is to bridge the gap between key/value stores (which are fast and highly scalable)
                  and traditional RDBMS systems (which are deep in functionality).
